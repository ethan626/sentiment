This is a Recurrent Neural Network which predicts consumer sentiment of a product based on the title. The model is trained on the product names and a one word score of the product. 90% of the data set is used for training and the remaining 10% is used for validation. 

This project was the week three challenge of Intro to Deep Learning with Siraj Raval.
